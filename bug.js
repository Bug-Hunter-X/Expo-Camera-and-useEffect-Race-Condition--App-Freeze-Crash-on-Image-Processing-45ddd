While building an Expo app, I encountered a rather unusual error related to the interaction between Expo's `Camera` component and the `useEffect` hook.  The error wasn't immediately apparent; it only manifested when certain image processing or manipulation steps were performed after capturing a photo. Specifically, the app would freeze or crash without providing a clear error message in the console, only a generic 'React Native' error or the app just stops responding.  The issue seemed tied to asynchronous operations within `useEffect` attempting to access or modify the captured image data before it was fully available, causing a race condition or data corruption.
